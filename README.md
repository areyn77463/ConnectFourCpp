# ConnectFourCpp
This program is a command-line implementation of the classic game Connect Four. You can play against a friend or against an AI opponent that uses the minmax algorithm to make its moves. The program is written in C++.

Skills Developed
While working on this project, I learned how to:

 - Implement a classic board game on the command-line interface (CLI)
 - Use the minmax algorithm to create an AI opponent
 - Score possible moves based on the rules of the game
 - Allow users to choose between playing against a friend or an AI opponent

## Compiling and Running the Program
To compile the program, use the following command:

`make`

To run the program and start a game, use the following command:

`./app`

The program will default to one player. To see the other options use:

`./app -h`

or 

`./app --help`

Enjoy playing a classic!!
